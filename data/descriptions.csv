This image depicts two passenger cars, one red and one blue, at a controlled intersection in a residential area.

The visual elements are:

A traffic light is installed, displaying a red signal (top light illuminated) for the approaching vehicles.

A Main road sign 201 (Priority road) is also present, although its function is superseded by the active traffic lights when they are operating.

The red car is behind the blue car and appears to be stopped or approaching the intersection.

The blue car is positioned near the center of the intersection, suggesting it is preparing to execute a turn.

Two green arrows indicate potential paths: one shows a turn to the right for the blue car, and the other shows a path to the right for the red car. Both paths are on the road that crosses the street the cars are currently on. The green arrows also trace the path of the cars through the intersection, suggesting the blue car is turning left and the red car is turning right.

The key conflict is that the traffic light is red for the drivers, which prohibits the start of the movement into the intersection."
