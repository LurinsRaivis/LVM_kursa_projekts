[Data](./data) folder contains all the data needed for testing:
  - Image URLs;
  - Descriptions;
  - Questions;
  - Answer options.

Each models' folder ([Google](./Google), [OpenAI](./OpenAI), [xAI](./xAI) includes two scripts - one for image recognizing, other for descriptions.

[images](./images) folder was created in order to collect URL for each image (it was easier through GitHub images).
