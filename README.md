[Data](./data) folder contains all the csv files needed for testing:
  - Image URLs ([image_URL](./data/image_URL.csv));
  - Descriptions ([descriptions](./data/descriptions.csv));
  - Questions ([questions](./data/questions.csv));
  - Answer options ([options](./data/options.csv)).

Each models' folder ([Google](./Google), [OpenAI](./OpenAI), [xAI](./xAI) includes two scripts - one for image recognizing, other for descriptions.

[images](./images) folder was created in order to collect URL for each image (it was easier through GitHub images).
