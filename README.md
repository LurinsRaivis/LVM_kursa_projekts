[Data](./data) folder contains all the csv files needed for testing:
  - Image URLs;
  - Descriptions;
  - Questions;
  - Answer options.

Each models' folder ([Google](./Google), [OpenAI](./OpenAI), [xAI](./xAI) includes two scripts - one for image recognizing, other for descriptions.

[Images](./images) folder was created in order to collect URL for each image (it was easier through GitHub images).

The final data was logged in file that I cannot add to the GitHub, but you may find it by clicking on this link - [Datu Kopa](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MoWl1rGhs3zfdqPcJQZeQf6FKcqPx20QTbQruEi2-5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
